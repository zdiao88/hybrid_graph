graph-processing
================

Leveraging best-fit graph format can improve the performance of graph processing. 
GraphChi is the first platform for graph processing on a sigle PC. The code is used to verifying our idea and learned from GraphChi. Also the configuration is similar to GraphChi.

DataSet: Twitter, LiveJournal,Netflix. 
Also the testdata/Test.txt is used to verify the correctness of SGD and ALS in a intuitive way. 

平台结构：
./application:应用程序
./bin:可执行文件
./core:图处理平台Engine
./preprocess:图数据预处理
./testdata:测试数据
